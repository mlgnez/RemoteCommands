# RemoteCommands
Run commands remotely from a raw github .txt file.

(If you do add / use this in your plugin, please credit me where you can.)

To get this to work for you: Go to "src/main/java/jrv1000/remotecommands/Remote" and change line 17 from my URL to your URL. Then you can edit the commands.txt file to run whatever you want. Quick tutorial for the commands.txt file: Put each commands you want to run on a seperate line, and you can put as many as you like.
